# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Real-device readiness (beta): `Examples/StraitReference`, a signable reference app
  (xcodegen) with Universal Links (`applinks:<host>`, UIKit scenes so a cold start is
  `closed`), the `straitref://` fallback, store sheet, Paste button, a Settings screen with
  the live runtime choice and an AASA check, an optional App Clip (`STRAIT_APP_CLIP=1`),
  `scripts/set-team.sh`, `build-device.sh`, `device-proof.sh` (XCUITest on a connected
  iPhone) and `testflight.sh` (archive + `-exportArchive` upload). Test plan in
  `Examples/StraitReference/TEST-PLAN.md`.
- `StraitLinks.lastInstallSettings` / `InstallSettings` / `replyInstallSettings(_:at:)`:
  the workspace's iPhone choice from the latest `/v1/match` reply, for settings and debug
  screens (never stored; nil before an answer or with an older engine).
- `StraitAppClip` (beta): App Clip -> full app handoff through a shared App Group
  (`saveInvocation` in the App Clip, `takeInvocation` once in the full app, 7-day window,
  https only), passed to `start(initialURL:)` for an exact deferred link.
- Design system v5: `StraitPasteButton` now defaults to the Strait look
  (`StraitPasteButton.straitConfiguration()`): the orange fill `#FF6A13` with ink text
  `#0F0D0A` (6.8:1) in light and dark, 8 pt corners, icon and label, at least 44 pt tall.
  Pass a `UIPasteControl.Configuration` to keep your own colours. New `StraitTokens`
  (generated from brand v5: colours light / dark, spacing, radii, type, durations) and
  `StraitTokens.dynamic(_:)` / `StraitColor.uiColor` for UIKit. Tests check the brand colour,
  AA contrast and that no blue or cool grey is in the palette.
- README: the common Strait SDK header (logo, promise, badges, links), a platform features
  table with the iPhone beta truth, Paste button screenshots, and "Docs and support".
- iPhone deferred-link method chosen by the customer at runtime (founder decision 10 Oct 2026):
  the once-per-install check reads the workspace's choice from the `/v1/match` reply
  (`ios.pasteHandoff`, Dashboard → Settings → iPhone installs) and reads the clipboard only
  when it is on and device matching found nothing (or is off). Nothing is baked into the app
  build and the choice is never stored, so changing it needs no app release. A reply without
  the field (older engine) means off. When `/v1/match` gets no answer, 429 or 5xx, the
  clipboard is left alone and the check runs again next launch. `StraitLinksConfig.clipboardBoost`
  is deprecated and ignored. New public function `replyPasteHandoff(_:)`.
- Clipboard boost order (B19): the first-launch deferred check now runs device matching
  (`/v1/match`) first; the clipboard is read and the handoff claimed only when that returns
  no match or fails. A device match no longer shows iOS's "Allow Paste" prompt. Both attempts
  share one `openId` and only the final `LinkEvent` is emitted. `StraitPasteButton` is unchanged.
- Store sheet (beta): `StraitLinks.openStoreSheet(url:options:presenter:completion:)` (also
  `Strait.openStoreSheet(_:…)`) shows `SKStoreProductViewController` or `SKOverlay` inside your
  app after `POST /v1/store-sheet`, saves the device match for that tap (`/v1/match-save`) and,
  opt-in, copies the clipboard-boost handoff link. New `StoreSheet`, `StoreProduct`,
  `StoreSheetOptions`, `StoreSheetResult`, `StoreSheetPresenting`, `SystemStoreSheetPresenter`
  (iOS), `StraitPasteboardWriting` (`SystemPasteboard` conforms).
- Referral codes (preview; shared-spec/proposals/referral-code.md, B21): a matched
  deferred `LinkEvent` (signal match, clipboard claim, `claimHandoff`) carries
  `referralCode` when the engine's reply has a valid one. Legacy `MatchResult` decodes
  `referralCode` too. New public function `replyReferralCode`.

## 0.8.0

- Optional iPhone clipboard boost (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B19), **off by default**:
  `StraitLinksConfig(clipboardBoost: true)`. On the first launch only, the SDK asks iOS
  whether a web link is on the clipboard (`UIPasteboard.detectPatterns`, no prompt) and
  only then reads it (iOS shows its paste prompt). A Strait handoff link is claimed via
  `POST /v1/handoff/claim` for an exact match (`route: .clipboard`); anything else falls
  back to signal matching. With the default config the clipboard is never touched.
- `claimHandoff(text:)` / `claimHandoff(itemProviders:)`, `handoffAvailable(completion:)`
  and `StraitPasteButton` (Apple's `UIPasteControl`, iOS 16+, no prompt).
- New core function: `parseHandoffUrl(_:linkHosts:)` (conformance vectors v7); new
  route `clipboard`.
- Privacy manifest comment corrected: the server keeps a keyed hash (HMAC) of the IP
  address and of its IPv6 /64, plus the /24 or /48 network prefix, not "a truncated
  prefix".

## 0.7.2

- Privacy hardening (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B18): the URL sent to `/v1/open` and
  `/v1/resolve`, and every report saved in the offline queue (`strait.pendingOpens`),
  is now host + path only; the query string and fragment are dropped, except the first
  `utm_source` pair, which the engine uses for channel attribution. Reports saved by an
  older version are stripped the next time the queue is read. Your app's `LinkEvent`
  (`rawUrl`, `url`, `params`) is unchanged.
- An expired remembered tap id (`strait.lastTap`, older than 7 days or unreadable) is now
  deleted at `start` and on `trackEvent`, instead of only being ignored.
- New core functions: `reportUrl(_:)`, `staleTap(_:now:)` (conformance vectors v6).

## 0.7.1

- Report the portrait screen width so a first launch in landscape still matches the tap
  (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B17): `collectDevice()` now sends the shorter side of
  `UIScreen.main.bounds` (it sent the orientation-dependent width).
- New core function: `portraitScreenWidth(_:_:)` (conformance vectors v5).

## 0.7.0

- Every attributed open now supplies the tap id (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B16):
  when `/v1/resolve` (Universal Link) or `/v1/match` (fingerprint) returns
  `clickId`, it is remembered as `strait.lastTap` and sent with conversion events.
  A reply without one (older engine) keeps the 0.6.0 behaviour (forget).
- New core function: `replyClickId` (conformance vectors v4).

## 0.6.0

- Conversion events carry the tap id (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B15): the tap id
  of the last attributed link open (a browser hand-off `strait_click`) is remembered
  under `strait.lastTap` and sent as `clickId` with `trackEvent` for 7 days. A newer
  short-link or fingerprint open forgets it. `trackEvent(_, clickId:)` overrides it.
- New core API: `eventClickId`, `rememberTap`, `ATTRIBUTION_WINDOW_MS`
  (conformance vectors v3).

## 0.5.0

**Renamed to Strait** (breaking, clean break; no aliases for the old names).

- Package, product, module and targets: `BridgeSDK` → `StraitSDK`
  (`import StraitSDK`), test target `StraitSDKTests`. Repo / package identity
  `strait-sdk-swift`.
- Types: `Bridge` → `Strait`, `BridgeConfig` → `StraitConfig`, `BridgeLinks` →
  `StraitLinks`, `BridgeLinksConfig` → `StraitLinksConfig`, `BridgeStorage` →
  `StraitStorage`, `BridgeTransport` → `StraitTransport`, `BridgeHTTPResponse` →
  `StraitHTTPResponse`, `BridgeSubscription` → `StraitSubscription`;
  `parseBridgeLink` / `parseBridgeClick` → `parseStraitLink` / `parseStraitClick`.
- Wire params: `strait_link` and `strait_click` only.
- Storage keys: `strait.deferredChecked`, `strait.pendingOpens` (old values are ignored).
- brand.json is final (Strait, https://usestrait.com, strait.link; the copyright holder is now "The Strait authors").
- Shared vectors (`conformance-vectors.json`) follow the rename.

## 0.4.0

- Every link open is reported exactly once (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B14).
  `LinkEvent.id` is now the open id (`newOpenId`, `o_<base36 ms>_<12 chars>`).
  Short links send `openId`, `appState`, `firstLaunch`, `at` with
  `/v1/resolve` (and fall back to `/v1/open` when the engine didn't record
  it); custom-scheme hand-offs and own https links are reported via
  `POST /v1/open` without delaying the event.
- Reports that get no answer, 429 or 5xx are saved in `BridgeStorage` under
  `bridge.pendingOpens` and retried on start, when the app becomes active and
  after any successful report (pruned to 7 days / 100). New
  `pendingOpenReports(completion:)` and `flushOpenReports(completion:)`.
- B4: a `bridge_click` tap id is removed from the destination;
  `ClassifiedUrl.destination` gains `clickId` (source-breaking for code that
  pattern-matches it).
- B6/B8: the deferred `/v1/match` sends `openId` + `at`; the check is marked
  done only once the engine answered (no answer / 429 / 5xx → `network`,
  retried next launch). `checkDeferred()` sends no `openId`.
- New pure helpers checked against `conformance-vectors.json` v2:
  `parseBridgeClick`, `takeClickId`, `pruneOpenQueue`, `shouldRetryReport`,
  `newOpenId`, `OPEN_QUEUE_MAX`, `OPEN_QUEUE_MAX_AGE_MS`.
- `at` is sent as whole milliseconds on `/v1/resolve`, `/v1/match` and `/v1/open`.
- `BridgeStorage.getItem` can't fail (it returns `String?`), so the RN rule
  "unreadable storage = deferred already checked" has no Swift equivalent.

### Packaging

- Ready for Swift Package Manager: a version tag `vX.Y.Z` is the release
  (SwiftPM reads tags straight from the repo; no registry account). The release
  workflow builds and tests the tag on macOS and checks this changelog names it.
- The repo URL and copyright holder come from `brand.json` (README install block
  + LICENSE applied by `scripts/brand.mjs`). MIT `LICENSE` added.

## 0.3.0

- `BridgeLinks` client at parity with the React Native SDK
  (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md B1–B6, B8–B13): Universal Links / custom scheme
  via `handle(url:)` / `handle(userActivity:)`, short-link resolve, app-state
  labels from UIApplication notifications, deferred check once per install,
  `onLink` with replay, `onLinkStart`, `checkDeferred`, `trackEvent`,
  `reportFingerprint`, `compareFingerprint`.
- Pure helpers ported 1:1 and checked against `conformance-vectors.json`:
  `browserScreenWidth`, `splitUrl`, `normalizeLinkHosts`, `parseBridgeLink`,
  `classifyUrl`, `AppStateTracker`.
- `collectDevice().screenWidth` now uses `browserScreenWidth` (ceil), matching
  what Safari reports. `DeviceFields` and `collectDevice()` are public.
- `Bridge.resolveDeferredLink` unchanged.

## 0.1.0

- Deferred match (`Bridge.resolveDeferredLink`) with golden-vector signature parity.
