# BridgeSDK (iOS / Swift)

Deferred deep linking for native iOS — the user taps your link, installs, and
lands on the right screen. No clipboard paste banner.

Part of [Bridge](../). The match signature is a Swift port kept in lockstep with
the server and every other SDK via [`shared-spec`](../shared-spec) golden vectors
(run by `swift test` in CI). 32-bit hash overflow is matched with `Int32` + `&*`.

> ⚠️ Verified by CI (`swift test` on macOS) against the golden vectors. Wire-up
> into a real app + on-device deferred-install verification still needs Xcode.

## Install (Swift Package Manager)

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/bazingga08/bridge-sdk-swift", from: "0.3.0")
```

## Use — `BridgeLinks` (direct + deferred links, analytics)

Create one client at launch and keep it for the app's lifetime.

```swift
import BridgeSDK

let bridge = BridgeLinks(BridgeLinksConfig(
    publishableKey: "bk_pub_live_…",
    endpoint: "https://go.yourbrand.com",
    linkHosts: ["links.yourbrand.com"]   // extra short-link domains: URLs or bare hosts
))

bridge.onLinkStart { start in showOpeningLink(start.id) }   // loading state
bridge.onLink { event in                                    // replays past events
    guard event.matched, let path = event.path else { return }
    router.open(path, params: event.params ?? [:])
}
```

### UIKit with scenes (SceneDelegate)

```swift
func scene(_ scene: UIScene, willConnectTo session: UISceneSession, options: UIScene.ConnectionOptions) {
    // The link that launched the app from closed (Universal Link or custom scheme).
    let launchURL = options.userActivities.first(where: { $0.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb })?.webpageURL
        ?? options.urlContexts.first?.url
    bridge.start(initialURL: launchURL)       // also runs the deferred check, once per install
}

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity) {
    bridge.handle(userActivity: userActivity)  // Universal Link while running
}

func scene(_ scene: UIScene, openURLContexts URLContexts: Set<UIOpenURLContext>) {
    URLContexts.forEach { bridge.handle(url: $0.url) }   // yourapp://… browser hand-off
}
```

Without scenes, do the same from `application(_:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:)`
(`launchOptions?[.url]`), `application(_:continue:restorationHandler:)` and
`application(_:open:options:)`.

### SwiftUI

```swift
@main struct ShopApp: App {
    init() { bridge.start() }
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            ContentView()
                .onOpenURL { bridge.handle(url: $0) }
                .onContinueUserActivity(NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb) { bridge.handle(userActivity: $0) }
        }
    }
}
```

SwiftUI delivers the cold-launch URL through `onOpenURL` too, so it is labelled
by app state rather than `closed`; if you need `closed` (and the first-launch
deferred skip), adopt a `UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor`/scene delegate and pass
the launch URL to `start(initialURL:)`.

### Lifecycle and storage

- `start` observes `UIApplication` didBecomeActive / willResignActive /
  didEnterBackground to label links `background` vs `foreground`. Set
  `observeLifecycle: false` and call `bridge.onAppState(.active | .inactive | .background)`
  to feed it yourself. `stop()` removes the observers.
- The once-per-install flag `bridge.deferredChecked` lives in
  `UserDefaults.standard` by default; pass any `BridgeStorage` to change that.
- `transport:` (a `BridgeTransport`, default `URLSession.shared`), `now:` and
  `device:` are injectable for tests. Callbacks run on the main queue
  (`callbackQueue: nil` runs them on whatever thread finished the work).

### Analytics + fingerprint check

```swift
bridge.trackEvent("purchase", value: 49.99, currency: "USD", linkId: event.linkId) { ok in }
bridge.reportFingerprint { json in }   // POST /v1/debug/fingerprint, origin "app"
bridge.compareFingerprint { json in }  // engine's app-vs-browser comparison
bridge.checkDeferred { event in }      // re-run the deferred check (debugging)
```

### `LinkEvent`

`id` · `kind` (`direct` / `deferred`) · `route` (`app_link`, `custom_scheme`,
`fingerprint`) · `appState` (`closed`, `background`, `foreground`) · `matched` ·
`reason` (`not_found`, `expired`, `password_protected`, `no_match`, `network`,
`invalid_url`) · `rawUrl` · `url` · `path` · `params` · `linkId` · `ms` · `at`.
A `LinkStart` with the same `id` fires first, before any network call.

## Behaviours (shared-spec/SDK-CONTRACT.md)

| # | Status |
|---|---|
| B1 publishableKey in every body | ✓ (`/v1/match`, `/v1/resolve`, `/v1/event`, `/v1/debug/fingerprint`; GET compare sends it as a query param) |
| B2 `screenWidth = browserScreenWidth(UIScreen.main.bounds.width)` | ✓ |
| B3 short links on link hosts → `POST /v1/resolve {publishableKey,url,platform:'ios'}` | ✓ (hosts via `normalizeLinkHosts`) |
| B4 custom scheme / https classification (`classifyUrl`) | ✓ |
| B5 app-state labels (`AppStateTracker`, 2000/1000 ms) | ✓ |
| B6 deferred once per install, skipped-but-marked when launched by a link | ✓ |
| B7 Android Play Install Referrer | n/a on iOS (`parseBridgeLink` is ported for parity) |
| B8 iOS deferred `POST /v1/match` with device fields | ✓ |
| B9 one event type, replay, start signal | ✓ |
| B10 never throws; network → `matched:false, reason:'network'` | ✓ |
| B11 JSON via `JSONSerialization` | ✓ |
| B12 `splitUrl` without `URLComponents` | ✓ |
| B13 `trackEvent`, `reportFingerprint`, `compareFingerprint` | ✓ |

Both `test-vectors.json` (signature) and `conformance-vectors.json` (pure
helpers) run under `swift test` in CI.

## Deferred match only (legacy, still supported)

```swift
let result = await Bridge.resolveDeferredLink(
    BridgeConfig(publishableKey: "bk_pub_live_…", endpoint: "https://go.yourbrand.com")
)
if result.matched, let url = result.longUrl {
    // route to url
}
```

**Publishable key:** Dashboard → Get started → Publishable key (`bk_pub_live_…`).
It's safe to include in your app. Never put your secret key (`bk_live_…`) in an app.

Collects only coarse device fields (screen width, scale, language, timezone);
the **server** adds the observed IP and computes the match signature.
